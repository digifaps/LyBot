A little project to get hands on with AI, sensors, robotics etc.
The project will be easily accessible as we will implement a basic set that is needed for building a self driving robot and will be expanded with non mandatory extra's to complicate things. So there should be something for everyone , the hardcore hacker and the father who likes to build stuff with his kid(s).

LiPo battery and voltage regulator:

(This part is very much a personal choice as things like eventual batteries lying around could be used or some format of battery that is allready used in your projects, bare in mind the power consumption can be intensive with neural networks, high cpu usage and the motors, the link below are merely examples of what I use)

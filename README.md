A little project to get hands on with AI, sensors, robotics etc.
The project will be easily accessible as we will implement a basic set that is needed for building a self driving robot and will be expanded with non mandatory extra's to complicate things. So there should be something for everyone , the hardcore hacker and the father who like to build stuff with his kid(s).
